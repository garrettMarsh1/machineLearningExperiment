ISSUES:
       When connecting traffic to the NN, upon reaching the final car the program freezes and cannot continue until manually reloaded. 
       Im sure this is a simple fix, but might need another set of eyes on it to pin point the issue. For now i just have the dummy AI 
       working with traffic. To switch to the NN controlling the traffic, change the control type in main to AI instead of DUMMY in the
       generateTraffic(N2) function.
