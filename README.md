# machineLearningExperiment

ISSUES:
        Roads still congesting, but the traffic brain is now up and running with the car brain! Now I need to figure out how to mutate the learning for the traffic to spawn in a way that creates a fair test course for the car. The traffic.js file needs to have the assessDamage function debugged, as the traffic is not being killed upon collision. All in all, the main goal now is to train the traffic network to spawn the traffic in only two of the three lanes at a time. Any and all contribution is welcome here.
